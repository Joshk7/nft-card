### What I learned

I was trying to go through this problem using CUBE CSS. First I set up the project with colors and fonts that I took from the figma file. Then, I did a CSS reset and set base styles for generic elements like body, main, and anchor tags. Then I defined a couple of COMPOSITION classes like flex and items-center. Once that was done, I defined UTILITY classes for padding and space. From there, the project looked pretty good, but I added more specific styling to places that needed it using BEM like BLOCK classes. There really weren't any great use cases for exceptions in this challenge so I didn't use them.
